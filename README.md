# JSGround

JSGround is a POC that I built in few hours for a JavaScript presentation I had to do. The code is far away from the
good practices and there is many things we can do... I've not enough time to spend on it's development at the moment
but the goal is to have something close of the [Swift playground](https://developer.apple.com/swift/blog/?id=24)
for JavaScript (a great challenge I think :p)

Feel free to contribute if you want to.
