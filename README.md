# JSGround

JSGround is a POC I built in few hours for a JavaScript presentation I'd to do. It's far away from good practices...
I've not enough time to spend on it at the moment but the goal is to have something close of the Swift playground for
JavaScript ;)

Feel free to contribute if you want to.
